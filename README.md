# kittyMusic.library
Extension for AmosKittens

This is a complete reimplantation of “AmosPro Msuic extension”, original was written in assembler, 
this is a reimplemented using the documentations as guide, and by trial and error, the aim is to allow Amos basic programs written for Music extension to work in Amos Kittens. The original extension is not compatible with Amos Kittens. And kittyMusic.library can not be used with Amos Pro.

My copyright / software license only extends to work on KittyMusic.library, I’m not the original author of the “AmosPro Music extension”, and I clime no copyright to the original source code, or binary files, nor do I clime any right to original sound & music. There these files are not included with this package. And should not be distributed with this package.

The license chosen, is MIT this so people can contribute to the extension, as well as bundle it with commercial games as binary or as source code. Obviously there is no warranty, and I take no responsibility for any bugs or defects.

**work in progress.**

This extension is not enabled by default to enable edit, 
amosKittens.cpp file on line 1334, and recompile.

Only the commands that have a description is implemented.
